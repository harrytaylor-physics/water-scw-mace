# AMENDMENTS

Every design decision made without a direct citation, or that resolves a
gap/ambiguity in `SPEC.md`, is logged here with a one-line rationale
(SPEC §10). Dated; newest first.

## 2026-07-28

- **A1 — Config parsing dependency.** SPEC §1 says "numpy, scipy, matplotlib
  only" but also specifies YAML run configs. PyYAML is added as a *config-only*
  dependency (not a compute dependency); no physics depends on it. Alternative
  considered: stdlib `tomllib`, rejected because SPEC explicitly says YAML.

- **A2 — AQUA table is (ρ,T)-indexed, not (P,T).** SPEC §2/§4 request
  `rho(P,T)`, `s(P,T)`, `grad_ad(P,T)`. The only AQUA table present is
  `aqua_eos_rhot_v1_0.dat`, tabulated on a (ρ,T) grid (1501×301) with P as an
  output column. `rho(P,T)` is therefore obtained by inverting the tabulated
  `P(ρ,T)` along `T = const` (P is monotone increasing in ρ at fixed T for this
  EOS). Inversion scheme and its error will be documented in
  `docs/eos_inversion.md`. The companion AQUA P-T table is not on disk.

- **A3 — `ad_grad` is tabulated directly.** SPEC §2 allows deriving `grad_ad`
  from `s` by finite difference "if not tabulated directly." It *is* tabulated
  (`ad_grad` column, `(dlogT/dlogP)_S`), so it is used directly; no
  finite-difference derivation is needed. `s` and `u` are also tabulated.

- **A4 — FP opacity factor-1000 confirmed.** Loading `T*_opacity.npz` and
  band-integrating `kappa` *raw* gives κ_P ≈ 3×10⁵–4×10⁶ cm²/g; after the
  mandated ×1e-3 scaling κ_P lands at 323–4170 cm²/g, inside SPEC §2's asserted
  1e1–1e4 window. The scaling is applied on load and asserted (hard-fail
  otherwise). FP files also carry `alpha`(=κ·ρ) and precomputed `planck`/
  `rosseland` scalars (in *raw* units); band-limited means are (re)computed
  from spectra on the common band rather than trusting these scalars.

- **A5 — HITEMP/POKAZATEL per-point spectra absent (OPEN — awaiting owner
  decision).** SPEC §2 lists HITEMP and POKAZATEL per-point spectra npz as
  inputs; neither is on disk. Present instead: FP spectra + `crossover_hitemp.json`
  containing *precomputed* HITEMP↔FP Planck/Rosseland ratios and M1–M4 crossover
  metrics per grid point. This forks the opacity-module design and gates the
  F1/F3 differential figures. Decision pending; will be recorded here once made.
